# Global Trade and Its Environmental Impact

# Project Overview 
This project analyzes the relationship between global trade and its environmental impact using datasets that include indicators for trade, environmental factors, and country-level attributes. The project aims to assess how trade policies and practices are linked to environmental metrics.

# Installation and Setup 

## Codes and Resources Used 
- **Editor Used:** Jupyter Notebook
- **Python Version:** 3.8 or higher

## Python Packages Used 
- **Data Manipulation:** `pandas, numpy`
- **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib, seaborn`

# Data
The datasets used in this project are sourced from the Quality of Government (QoG) institute, which provides information about a wide range of governance indicators for different countries over time.

## 
1. QoG Basic Time-Series Dataset (January 2024 Version)
File: `qog_bas_ts_jan24.csv`
Description: This dataset includes multiple indicators related to economic, social, and environmental factors across countries and time.

2. QoG Environmental Indicators Dataset (September 2021 Version)
File: `qog_ei_ts_sept21.csv`
Description: This dataset provides environmental metrics, including pollution, emissions, and resource utilization metrics for various countries.

# Conclusion 

In this analysis, I explore the relationship between international trade and pollution levels using data from the Basic Economic and Politics Dataset and the Environmental Indicators Dataset. Initially, I hypothesized that higher trade levels would lead to increased air pollution. However, after comparing data from five major global trading nations, no clear correlation between higher trade activity and increased pollution rates was found. This suggests the need for a more comprehensive analysis that considers factors such as the types of goods produced, the frequency of trade activity, and the strength of environmental regulations before drawing definitive conclusions.
